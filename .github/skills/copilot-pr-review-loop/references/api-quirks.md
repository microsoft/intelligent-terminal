# GitHub API Quirks (Verified)

API behaviors that matter for the Copilot review loop. All verified
against the current API surface — read this before reaching for an
alternative API or modifying the bundled scripts.

## GraphQL trigger — `requestReviewsByLogin` is the supported path

```graphql
mutation($p: ID!) {
  requestReviewsByLogin(input: {
    pullRequestId: $p,
    botLogins: ["copilot-pull-request-reviewer"]
  }) {
    pullRequest { number }
  }
}
```

Verified empirically against personal repos without Copilot Pro AND
org repos with Copilot Enterprise. Works for both initial-add and
re-request (no special re-request mutation).

Three GraphQL traps:

1. Mutation is **`requestReviewsByLogin`**, NOT `requestReviews`.
   `RequestReviewsInput` (used by `requestReviews`) does not expose a
   `botLogins` field, so it can't request a bot reviewer at all —
   `botLogins` is the central field on `requestReviewsByLogin`.
2. Field is **`botLogins`**, NOT `userLogins`. The latter returns
   `Could not resolve user with login 'Copilot'`.
3. Slug is **`copilot-pull-request-reviewer`** (the App slug). The
   display login `Copilot` returns `Could not resolve bot with slug
   'Copilot'`.

Verify success via a new `copilot_work_started` event in the issue
timeline (see SKILL.md Gotchas "HTTP 200 / exit 0 is NOT proof").
`01-request-review.ps1` enforces this by comparing the event `id`
(monotonic) before and after the trigger.

### Other trigger paths — DO NOT USE

- **`requestReviews` with `botLogins`** → input type rejects the
  field. Don't try variants.
- **REST `POST /pulls/<n>/requested_reviewers` with
  `reviewers[]=Copilot`** → can return HTTP 201 while silently
  dropping the bot. Not used by the script.
- **`gh pr edit --add-reviewer Copilot`** → returns `'Copilot' not
  found` on current `gh`. Not used by the script.
- **`@copilot` PR comment** → see SKILL.md Gotchas (summons the
  Coding Agent, not the reviewer bot).

## GraphQL `latestReviews` — stale cache, do NOT use

```graphql
# DO NOT — stale projection:
pullRequest(number:$pr){ latestReviews(first:50){ nodes{...} } }

# USE INSTEAD — always current:
pullRequest(number:$pr){ reviews(last:100){ nodes{...} } }
```

`latestReviews` is a "latest per user" projection with stale-cache
behavior: a fresh Copilot review can be absent for several minutes
after submission, while `reviews(last:100)` reflects it immediately.
Using `latestReviews` for in-flight or convergence checks causes the
script to operate on an obsolete commit OID — either falsely
declaring convergence or timing out for a review that already
exists.

`02-check-review-status.ps1` uses `reviews(last:100)` filtered
client-side to the Copilot reviewer login.

## Reply + resolve mutations — both work

```graphql
mutation($tid: ID!, $body: String!) {
  addPullRequestReviewThreadReply(input: {
    pullRequestReviewThreadId: $tid,
    body: $body
  }) { comment { id } }
}

mutation($tid: ID!) {
  resolveReviewThread(input: { threadId: $tid }) {
    thread { isResolved }
  }
}
```

## `isOutdated` ≠ `isResolved` — current unresolved state is truth

A thread can be `isOutdated: true` (Copilot's comment points at lines
that have since changed) while still `isResolved: false`. These
threads:

- Still need reply + resolve in the per-round loop. A thread can
  become outdated mid-round when your own fix shifts the cited
  lines. Filtering on `!isOutdated` would silently drop those
  threads, leaving the PR's open-conversations list non-empty even
  after the underlying code is fixed.
- `03-list-open-threads.ps1` therefore lists every unresolved
  thread with no `isOutdated` filter.
- `10-cleanup-outdated.ps1` is a safety net only — for the rare
  case where a thread becomes outdated AFTER your last per-round
  fetch.

## Review latency — don't poll faster than ~3 min

Copilot reviews typically post 3–6 minutes after the request,
occasionally up to ~10 minutes. There is no progress signal;
polling more often than every ~3 min wastes API budget without
making the review arrive sooner.

## `gh api graphql -F` coerces strings — use `-f` for `String!`

The `gh` CLI distinguishes its two flag forms:

- `-F key=value` — type inference. Values parsing as int, bool, or
  null are sent as that JSON literal.
- `-f key=value` — always sends as raw string.

For any GraphQL variable declared `String!` (e.g. `owner`, `repo`,
`body`, `tid`, `after`), use **`-f`**. A reply body that happens to
be `"true"`, `"null"`, or all digits would otherwise be coerced and
the call fails with a type error. Keep `-F` only for genuinely
numeric or boolean variables (e.g. `pr: Int!`).

```powershell
# Wrong — body could be coerced
gh api graphql -f query=$q -F body=$Body

# Right
gh api graphql -f query=$q -f body=$Body
```

## Native `gh` exit codes bypass `$ErrorActionPreference`

`gh` is a native executable, not a PowerShell cmdlet, so a non-zero
exit does **not** throw even when `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'`.
Without an explicit check the script will print misleading success
messages after a failed API call, and the loop will falsely declare
convergence on auth issues, rate limits, or transient 5xx.

Additional trap: `gh api graphql` can exit 0 for an HTTP 200 whose
JSON body carries a top-level `errors` array. Treat that as a failed
call too.

The shared helpers in [scripts/_lib.ps1](../scripts/_lib.ps1)
(`Invoke-Gh` and `Invoke-GhGraphQL`) run `gh` via
`System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo` and return the native exit
code on the result object's `ExitCode` property (NOT via
`$LASTEXITCODE` — the process-start path bypasses PowerShell's
native-command machinery). They also parse the GraphQL `errors`
array on the response body. All bundled scripts dot-source
`_lib.ps1` and use these wrappers — do the same in any new
script.

## `git stash push` argument order

```bash
git stash push -m "local-build" -- src/path/a src/path/b   # correct
git stash push -- src/path/a src/path/b -m "local-build"   # SILENTLY drops -m
```

The `-m` MUST come before the `--` path separator.
